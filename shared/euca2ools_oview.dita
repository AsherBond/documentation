 <title>Overview of Euca2ools</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
 	<p>Euca2ools are command-line tools for interacting with web services. Most commands in Euca2ools export a
 		REST or Query-based API compatible with Amazonâ€™s EC2 and S3 services. You can use these tools with
 		both the Eucalyptus cloud-computing platform and Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2). A few
 		other commands are specific to Eucalyptus and are noted in the command description.</p>
 	<p>The commands in Euca2ools that are compatible with Amazon EC2 or S3 services generally accept
 		the same options and honor the same environmental variables. However, Euca2ools was designed from scratch in Python, relying on the Boto library and M2Crypto toolkit.</p>
 	<note>Some operations in Euca2ools are not supported in certain Eucalyptus networking modes. For
 		example, security groups and elastic IPs are not supported in both Static and System modes. See your cloud administrator for details. </note>
