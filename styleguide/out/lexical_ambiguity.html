	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Lexical Ambiguity</h1>

	
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Lexical ambiguity happens when a single, unspecified word can have multiple referents. It is most commonly seen with pronouns.</p>

 	
 	<p class="p">This </p>

 	
 	<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Examle 1</h2>
 		
 		<p class="p"><em class="ph i">The key itself is the private key in a key pair.</em></p>
 
 		<p class="p">Which key is itself? This is a fairly simple case that can be resolved by describing the key more clearly, such as: “The User key in the previous example is the private key in a key pair.” </p>

 	</div>

 	
 	<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 2</h2>
 		
 		<p class="p"><em class="ph i">The changes to your distribution's logging configuration take effect within 12 hours, but it may take less time.</em></p>
 
 		<p class="p">"It" should refer either to the configuration or the distribution, but not to "changes"--which is plural. The quick way out of this example is to drop the word it; the ambiguity then disappears.</p>

 	</div>

 	
 	<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 3</h2>
 		
 		<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Those parameters include all of the response parameters, including status parameters, which tell you whether or not the sender successfully changed the payment instrument.</em></p>

 		<p class="p">What is the antecedent to "which," all the parameters, or just those for status? Assuming the
 			antecedent is “status,” you can put the parenthetic subclause into parentheses, and remove the confusing comma. “…parameter, including the status parameters (which tell you whether …).</p>

 		<p class="p">This brings up an important side point. The more commas you have in a sentence, the more likely someone is going to misread it.</p>

 	</div>

 	
 	
 
 <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 4</h2>
 	
 	<p class="p"><em class="ph i">In that case, you need to use the verification process described in the Appendix.</em></p>

 	<p class="p">"In that case" is a common phrase from certain non-native writers. It is used to mean "When the
 		last thing I stated happens." Frequently it works, but just as frequently there are two or three
 		"cases" and no indication which one is "that case." Unlike other languages, English has no
 		different word for “this.” So we have to use a couple more words. For example, “When authentication fails, you need to use the verification process…”</p>

 </div>

 	
 	<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 5</h2>
 		
 		<p class="p"><em class="ph i">By default, network access is turned off to a new RDS DBSecurityGroup; you must specifically authorize access to an IP range for a new security group after it is created.</em></p>

 		<p class="p">What is "it," the IP range or the security group? It might be obvious if you stop and think about it…but the point is to make the writing clear so that the reader doesn’t have to stop and think.</p>

 	</div>

 
 <div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 6</h2>
 	
 	<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Accept the default values for this example, then click Continue.</em></p>

 	<p class="p">Does "for this example" refer to default values that have been put into the example or merely the act of accepting the values?
 	Rewritten for clarity you can see the two meanings: “For this example, accept any default values,
 	and then click Continue.” Or: “Accept the default values given in this example, and then click Continue.</p>
”
 </div>

 	
 	<div class="example"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Example 7</h2>
 		
 		<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Eucalyptus runs a web server and configures it on the front end machine when it installs
 			the software.</em></p>

 	<p class="p">Does the second "it" refer to Eucalyptus, the web server, or the front end machine? The first
 		"it" was clearly the web server. Again, you can stop and reason it out, but you shouldn’t have to. Remember that no matter how fast we read, it’s still left-to-right; so when you stack up a row of nouns, and then put in an unqualified pronoun, the reader naturally wants to make the nearest noun into the antecedent. </p>
