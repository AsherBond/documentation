 <h1 class="title topictitle1">Is It a Process or a Procedure?</h1>

	
 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The major difference between a process and a procedure is that a process amplifies a concept, and a procedure is a set of elemental instructions. A process either clarifies how something works or describes a series of procedures. By contrast, a procedure instructs how to do something—describing each necessary step completely. You can keep that distinction clear for the reader by using different styles.</p>

  
  <p class="p">A process can answer the questions: How does it work?, What happens when?, and When do I need to do it?</p>

  
 <p class="p"> A procedure primarily answers the question: How do I do it?. But it can also answer: Where do I do it?, and What does the result look like?</p>

  
  <p class="p">At Eucalyptus we use the following process and procedure terminology:</p>

  <ul class="ul">
  <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Task—</strong>A discrete, complete activity. A procedure completes a task; a process can be composed of several tasks.</li>

  
   <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Step—</strong>An elemental action in a procedure.</li>

  
   <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Substep—</strong>An incremental pieces of a step. Substeps are often necessary to break down a step when is has multiple components.</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="p">Art, skill, and house style are involved in defining the gray line between a complex procedure
   with many substeps and a process containing multiple procedures. Deciding which is better comes
   as a part of the developmental edit. As you gain experience with our house style, your writing
   becomes more consistent, requiring fewer edits.</p>

These distinctions are important in deciding where and how to present the procedure. If it's part of a process or life cycle, you might want to group its elements together and in sequential order with other procedures of the same kind. If it stands alone, you might need to decide how much prominence it needs and how to make it easy for the reader to find.">Writing Procedures</a></div>
