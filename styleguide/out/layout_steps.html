 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Procedures are instructions; they step the reader through a task from beginning to end. Each step might require some detail, such as navigation, substeps, or examples; but before you write the details, you need to sketch out the complete list of steps and verify that you have it all.</p>

  
  <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> Every procedure is based on some prerequisite knowledge. That knowledge might be rudimentary, like knowing what the ALT key is. In technical writing, it's more likely that you will set a knowledge level more like: "Familiarity with SQL commands."</div>

  
  <p class="p">When writing a procedure that is a part of a process or life cycle, you might write some simple procedures (such as accessing a UI), which you can assume the reader has mastered for the remaining procedures in that group.</p>

  
  <p class="p">Procedures are comprised of a list of one or more steps. Each step is written as a simple command, beginning with either a verb or a navigation point. If navigation in the UI is needed before an action, give the navigation instruction first.</p>
