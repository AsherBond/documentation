 	<p class="p">A process can answer the questions: How does it work?, What happens when?, and When do I need to do it? Because they can describe general sequences, processes are less rigorously defined than procedures are. For example, whereas procedures are comprised of a discrete collection of elemental instructions, processes have a variety of components—of unequal complexity. The one basic rule is that a process must convey a cohesive whole that progresses over time. If the concept can't be expressed as a temporal sequence, then it isn't a process.</p>

 	
 	<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Process Standards</h2>
 		
 		<ul class="ul">
 			<li class="li">The content of processes can vary according to the situation and needs. Basically, however, a process should illustrate how a single concept works or flows. Anything extraneous to that one concept should be removed, or only briefly referred to.</li>

 			<li class="li">Most processes are greatly enhanced with a diagram, which helps the reader see the entire concept at a glance. However, a diagram should supplement, not replace, written descriptions.</li>

 			<li class="li">Mark up a process as an ordered list with special attributes. The XSL and CSS will handle the rest of the formatting.</li>

 			<li class="li">Refer to a collection of different components as tasks. That is, a process that is a collection of tasks, procedures, and steps that should be collectively called tasks in the documentation.</li>

 		</ul>

<div><a class="navheader_parent_path" href="process_or_procedure.html" title="The major difference between a process and a procedure is that a process amplifies a concept, and a procedure is a set of elemental instructions. A process either clarifies how something works or describes a series of procedures. By contrast, a procedure instructs how to do something—describing each necessary step completely. You can keep that distinction clear for the reader by using different styles.">Is It a Process or a Procedure?</a></div>
<div><a class="navheader_parent_path" href="writing_procedures.html" title="A procedure can stand alone, or be a part of a greater process or life cycle. These distinctions are important in deciding where and how to present the procedure. If it's part of a process or life cycle, you might want to group its elements together and in sequential order with other procedures of the same kind. If it stands alone, you might need to decide how much prominence it needs and how to make it easy for the reader to find.">Writing Procedures</a></div>
