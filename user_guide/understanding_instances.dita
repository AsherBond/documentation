 <conbody>
  <p><draft-comment>Include instance usage suggestions, instance types (are there any included in an install?), Windows instance
  types (any included in an install?), compute resources management (a la AWS), using tags.</draft-comment></p>
 	
 	<draft-comment>There are instance types that are in the install. Memory, CPU, disk. These can be customized (an admin task).
 		
 		Where can I find instance types? euca-describe-availabilityzones --verbose
 		
 		No images downloaded.
 		
 		Compute resources management, section: yes. Use euca-authorize for ping and SSH. Then you can define custom security groups for other things (web access).</draft-comment>
