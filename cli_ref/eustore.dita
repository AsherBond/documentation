 <conbody>
 	<p>Commands that begin with the <codeph>eustore-</codeph> prefix give  you access
 		to the Eucalyptus image store. Eucalyptus offers some updated base images available on our
 		servers. We have a catalog file that contains metadata about those images. The
 		<codeph>eustore-</codeph> commands give you access to these images and let you use a single command to download and install an image to your cloud .</p>
