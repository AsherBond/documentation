 <title>Storage Overview</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  
 	<p>Eucalyptus uses three types of storage:</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li>Buckets (provided by Walrus)</li>
 		<li>Elastic block storage (EBS) volumes (provided by the Storage Controller)</li>
 		<li>Ephemeral (provided by the Node Controller)</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>Buckets and volumes keep the data across instance termination. This is called persistent
 		storage. Volumes and ephemeral provide the familiar block interface and appear  and are used as
 		hard disks. Buckets are designed to be massively scalable. Ephemeral storage is only meant to be temporary.</p>
