 <title>Reporting Tasks</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>This section explains the tasks associated with the Eucalyptus reporting feature. These tasks
  	are divided into where you will run reports from, either the Cloud Controller (CLC) or the data
  	warehouse. Follow the steps listed below to configure and then find the tasks associated with
  	reports.</p>
 	<ol>
 		<li>Change the Eucalyptus configuration to enable reporting. For more
 			information, see <xref href="reporting_enabling.dita"/>.</li>
 		<li>Decide which Eucalyptus component you want to run reports against.
 			<ul>
 				<li>When you install Eucalyptus, you automatically get the ability to run reports against the
 					CLC. This reporting functionality is done in the Eucalyptus Administrator Console. For further information, see
 					<xref href="reporting_tasks_clc.dita"/>.</li>
 				<li>Many environments choose to focus the CLC function on the cloud processes, rather than on
 					reporting processes. For these needs, Eucalyptus supports exporting data from the CLC to a data
 					warehouse and running reports against the data in that data warehouse. For more information, see
 					<xref href="reporting_tasks_dw.dita"/>.</li>
