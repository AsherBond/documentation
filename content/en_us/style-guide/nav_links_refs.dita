	<title>Providing Navigation, Links, and References</title>
	<shortdesc>We can help readers navigate more quickly and reduce translation costs if we use consistent methods and phrases to introduce referents and links. Navigation eases readersâ€™ experience with documentation. It enables them to see what information is available, understand how it might be inter-related, and sometimes to move quickly from point to point within and across information resources.</shortdesc>
