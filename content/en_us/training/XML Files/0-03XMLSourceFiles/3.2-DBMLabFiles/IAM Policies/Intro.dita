    <title>Lab - Managing Eucalyptus Policies</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>In this lab exercise you will test a non-administrative user’s default permissions in
                the cloud by performing operations using the Eucalyptus Administrator Console and
                euca2ools.   You will then create a policy and assign it to the group of which the
                non-administrative user is a member.  Finally, you will test the policy by logging
                in as the non-administrative user and attempting to perform tasks within the cloud. 
                The non-administrative user is named <i>normal</i>. </p>
