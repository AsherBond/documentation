    <title>Lab - Managing Eucalyptus Accounts, Users, and Groups</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context><p>In this lab exercise you will manage accounts, users, and groups using the
                Eucalyptus Administrator Console. </p><p>You will log in to the <i>eucalyptus</i>
                account as the user <i>admin</i> and add a new cloud administrator user. After
                logging in as this new cloud administrator, you will add a new <i>sales</i> account
                to the cloud. You will also add a new group named <i>west</i> to the <i>sales</i>
                account.</p><p>Each new account created automatically includes a new <i>admin</i>
                user for that account. You will log in as <i>admin</i> to the <i>sales</i> account
                and add a <i>normal</i> (non-administrative) user to the <i>sales</i> account.   You
                will also add the <i>normal</i> user to the <i>west</i> group in the <i>sales</i>
                account.</p><p>You will finish by logging in to the Administrator Console as the
                    <i>normal</i> user in the <i>sales</i> account and downloading the user’s
                credentials.</p><p>The following diagram describes relationships between the
                accounts, groups, and users in this lab.</p><p/><image href="images/LabDiagram.png"
