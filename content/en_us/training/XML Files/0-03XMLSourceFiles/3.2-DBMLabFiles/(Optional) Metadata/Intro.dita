    <title>Optional Lab - Working with Metadata Services</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context> In this optional lab exercise you will work with Eucalyptus-defined instance
            metadata and user-supplied userdata, both of which are accessible through the Eucalyptus
            metadata services.  From an instance, you will download from the Cloud Controller the
            list of available metadata keys and then view the values associated with a few keys.
             Then you will customize an EMI image so that when it is used to launch an instance,
            that instance will work with user-supplied userdata to automatically attach to a volume,
            partition the volume, create a file system on the volume, and then mount the file
            system. <p>Lab Objectives:</p><ul id="ul_k34_5wk_13">
