 <conbody>
  <p>In this method the user uses the Eucalyptus Administrator Console to request a new account from
   the cloud administrator.  The cloud administrator could either see the request via email or
   notice the pending request in the Administrator Console.  Either way, the cloud administrator
   would either approve or deny the request in the Administrator Console.  An email is sent to the
   user with either the denial or with the information about how to access the cloud and log in.
   Approved accounts are listed with a registration status of CONFIRMED in the Administrator
   Console.  Pending account requests are listed with a status of REGISTERED in the Administrator
   Console. </p>
