 <title>Login Profile</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>A login profile consists of a login name and password. A login profile is required for any user
   to access the Eucalyptus Administrator Console. Cloud or account administrators will need to
   create a user name and password for any user before they will be able to log in to the
   Administrator Console. While the Administrator Console is primarily a cloud administration tool,
   it can also be used by normal users to change their own password and download their own cloud
   credentials (keys, certificate, and <filepath>eucarc</filepath> file).</p>
