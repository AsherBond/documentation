 <title>Accounts and Resources</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Accounts also include resources, which are entities or objects with which users interact. These
   can include other instances, volumes, buckets, images, IP addresses, availability zones, key
   pairs, snapshots, and vmtypes.</p>
  <p>Resources have friendly names as well as Eucalyptus resource names (ERNs). Friendly names can
   generally be used as command-line arguments, whereas ERNs must be used when creating access
   control policies.</p>
