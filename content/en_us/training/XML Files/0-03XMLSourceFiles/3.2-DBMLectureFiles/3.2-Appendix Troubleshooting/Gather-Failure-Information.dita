 <title>Gather Failure Information</title>

 <conbody>
  <p>First you need to gather as much information about the failure as possible.  What operation is
   the user trying to complete?   Is the user getting an error message?  Are there symptoms to
   report?  It might be useful to know if there have been any recent changes to the cloud software,
   cloud hardware, or the image that the user is using. </p>
  <p>Questions to ask include:</p>
