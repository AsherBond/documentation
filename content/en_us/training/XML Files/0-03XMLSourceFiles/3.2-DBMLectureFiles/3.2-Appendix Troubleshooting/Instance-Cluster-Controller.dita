 <title>Cloud Problem: Cluster Controller</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>If the Node Controller does not report the instance, check the Cluster Controller to ensure
   that it reports sending the instance to the Node Controller.Â  Search the
    <filepath>cc.log</filepath> file for <cmdname>RunInstances</cmdname> using the following
    command:<codeblock>cat /var/log/eucalyptus/cc.log | grep RunInstances [| less]</codeblock><note>The
    last part of the command (<cmdname>| less</cmdname>) is optional, but may be useful if a large
    amount of data is returned. You can also use <cmdname>grep</cmdname> to search for the instance
    ID.</note><note>You can also use <cmdname>grep</cmdname> to search for instance ID in the
     <filepath>cc.log</filepath> on the Cluster Controller.   This will display log information
    related to launching and monitoring the instance.</note>If the command was issued by the Cluster
   Controller but not received by the Node Controller, this could indicate a communication problem
   between the two hosts. </p>
  <p>If there is no instance data in the <filepath>cc.log</filepath> file, then it is likely that
   the problem could be listed in the Cloud Controller log file.  Move to that host to continue
   troubleshooting. </p>
