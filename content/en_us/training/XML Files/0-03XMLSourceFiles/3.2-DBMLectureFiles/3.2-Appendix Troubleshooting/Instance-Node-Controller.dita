 <title>Cloud Problem: Node Controller</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>If you suspect a problem with the cloud is causing an instance launch problem, start your
   troubleshooting efforts at the Node Controller. <ol id="ol_nfh_dpw_bh">
    <li>To find the Node Controller where the instance is running or trying to run, use
      <cmdname>euca-describe-nodes</cmdname> which lists the Node Controllers and the instance IDs
     running on each of them. You must test the problem on the same Node Controller that the user
     experienced the problem.</li>
    <li>Use the <cmdname>grep</cmdname> utility to search <filepath>nc.log</filepath> file on the
     Node Controller for the relevant instance
     ID:<codeblock>cat /var/log/eucalyptus/nc.log | grep &lt;instance_ID></codeblock>If image has
     been handed to the hypervisor, it is likely an image problem and not cloud problem. Â  </li>
    <li>Look for errors in downloading items from Walrus.</li>
    <li>Look for <cmdname>libvirt</cmdname> errors in launching an instance. </li>
   </ol></p>
  <p>If no instance data is found in the <filepath>nc.log</filepath> file on the Node Controller,
   then it is likely that the problem could be listed in the Cluster Controller log file.  Move to
   that host to continue troubleshooting.  </p>
