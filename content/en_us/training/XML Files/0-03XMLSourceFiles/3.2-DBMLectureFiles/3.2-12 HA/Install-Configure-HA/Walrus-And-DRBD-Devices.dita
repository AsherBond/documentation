 <title>Walrus and DRBD Devices</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The enabled Walrus service writes to the DRBD replicated resource configured as
    <cmdname>r0</cmdname>. The <cmdname>r0</cmdname> resource, in turn, writes to the DRBD devices
   configured on the two Walrus hosts. These devices are configured as
    <filepath>/dev/drbd1</filepath>. The DRBD devices, in turn, write to the Linux
    <filepath>/dev/sdb1</filepath> devices. These Linux devices actually direct data to specific
   storage disks.</p>
