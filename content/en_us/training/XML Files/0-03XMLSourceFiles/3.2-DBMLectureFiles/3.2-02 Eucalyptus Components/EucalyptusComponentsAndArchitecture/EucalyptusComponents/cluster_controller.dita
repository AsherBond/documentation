  <p>The Cluster Controller (CC) is the front end for a cluster in a Eucalyptus cloud. It is written
   in C and deployed as a Web service inside Apache. It manages the compute nodes (Node Controllers)
   in the cluster as well as instance execution.  </p>
  <p>The Cluster Controller communicates with the Storage Controller and Node Controllers using SOAP
   with WS-Security. It provides information to the Cloud Controller regarding aggregate resource
   availability of the Node Controllers, and schedules virtual machine execution on specific Node
   Controllers. </p>
  <p>A Eucalyptus cloud may contain several clusters, however each cluster can have only one active
   Cluster Controller. A second, passive Cluster Controller may be provisioned for high availability
   purposes.</p>
  <p>Depending on which network mode the cloud is configured in, the Cluster Controller might also
   perform a number of network functions on behalf of running instances. It might map the private,
   cloud-internal IP addresses used by instances to their public IP addresses that are used for
   cloud-external communications. It might also act as an IP router between instances running in the
   cloud and external nodes. Lastly, it might implement and enforce the firewall rules that comprise
   security groups.</p>
