 <title>Eucalyptus Architecture Examples</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Eucalyptus cloud architectures can be thought of in terms of scale and technological diversity.
   They range from single-server proof-of-concept (POC) environments all the way to multiple-cluster
   architectures running dozens of Node Controllers and high availability configurations. Six
   different architecture examples are provided in this section. These six examples can be divided
   into four categories.<ul id="ul_x2v_wy2_1h">
    <li>Proof-of-Concept (POC)</li>
    <li>Single-Cluster</li>
    <li>Multi-Cluster</li>
    <li>Eucalyptus HA</li>
