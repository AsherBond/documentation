  <p>The Walrus is a Java-based equivalent to Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3). The Walrus is
   the Eucalyptus cloud component that handles bucket-based object storage for the cloud. Walrus
   provides persistent storage to both instances running within the cloud as well as to programs
   running outside of the cloud. Programs outside of the cloud can access the Walrus because it
   exposes S3-compatible SOAP and REST interfaces outside the cloud. Some customers have used the
   Walrus as a separate Storage-as-a-Service solution. The Walrus also provides storage for the
   Eucalyptus Machine Images, Eucalyptus Kernel Images, and Eucalyptus Ramdisk Images along with
   Eucalyptus Block Store volume snapshots. </p>
  <p>Only one active Walrus can be configured per Eucalyptus cloud, but a second, passive Walrus can
   be configured for high availability purposes. </p>
