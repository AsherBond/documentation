  <p>The Cloud Controller (CLC) is a Java-based AWS EC2-compatible interface to a Eucalyptus cloud
   that offers SOAP and "Query" interfaces, as well as a Web interface to the outside world. It
   handles all authentication, as well as high-level provisioning, resource scheduling, accounting,
   reporting, and quota management in the cloud. It also exposes an administrative interface for
   managing accounts, users, groups, access control, quotas, and vmtype settings. </p>
  <p>The administrative interface is accessed at the URL https://&lt;CLC_public_IP>:8443Â while other
   user-level services are accessed at the URL http://&lt;CLC_public_IP>:8773.</p>
  <p>Only one active Cloud Controller can be provisioned per cloud, but a second, passive Cloud
   Controller can be provisioned for high availability purposes.</p>
