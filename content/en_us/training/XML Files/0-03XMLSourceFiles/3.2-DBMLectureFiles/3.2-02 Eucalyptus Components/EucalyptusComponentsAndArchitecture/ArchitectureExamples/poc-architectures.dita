 <title>Proof-of-Concept Architectures</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p/>
  <p>A Eucalyptus proof-of-concept (POC) can be created with a simple configuration of one or two
   hosts. </p>
  <p>A single-host architecture is a common architecture used in pre-sale proof-of-concept
   deployments for testing and evaluation.Â  In this architecture all Eucalyptus software components
   are installed on a single host.  This type of installation is useful for functional testing but
   is not useful for scale and load testing.  This architecture can be easily deployed using the
   Eucalyptus FastStart ISO or by using a normal software package installation. All storage is
   typically provided by the local disks on this host.  </p>

  <p/>
  <p>In a two-host proof-of-concept configuration, all front-end components (Cloud Controller,
   Walrus, Cluster Controller, and Storage Controller) run on one of the hosts, and the other host
   is configured as a Node Controller. The Walrus and Storage Controller use the internal disk space
   of the front-end machine.  This architecture can also be easily deployed using the Eucalyptus
   FastStart ISO or by using a normal software package installation.</p>
