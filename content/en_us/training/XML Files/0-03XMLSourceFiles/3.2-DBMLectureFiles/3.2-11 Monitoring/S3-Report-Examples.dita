    <b>Group by</b> was set to <b>None</b>. </p>

  <p>The next example shows an instance report where <b>Criteria</b> was again set to <b>User</b>,
   but this time <b>Group by</b> was set to <b>Account</b>.</p>

    <p>The report contains values for Max Num, Max (GB), and GB-days. Max Num reports the maximum
      number of buckets deployed during the report period. Max (GB) reports the maximum number of
      GBs that were deployed during the report period. GB-days refers to [number of days allocated]
      x [number of GBs allocated]. Bear in mind that number of days and GBs can be fractional, and
      it adds them all up. You could have 80 objects of 100MB, each allocated for 3 hours, and the
      result would be 1 GB-Day (0.1*80*/(24/3)).</p>
  <p>In these example reports, the user admin in the eucalyptus account owned a maximum of 3 buckets
   during the report period.  Those buckets consumed less than 1GB of space for less than 1 day. </p>
