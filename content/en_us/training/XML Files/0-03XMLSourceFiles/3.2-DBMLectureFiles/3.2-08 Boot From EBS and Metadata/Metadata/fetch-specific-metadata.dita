 <title>Fetch a Metadata Value</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>From an instance, you can use the command shown below to fetch the value associated with a
   specific metadata key name.  In the case where there are nested key names below a key name, the
   names of the nested key name will be returned instead.  Unless you know the last key name in a
   series of nested key names, you could use an iterative set of <cmdname>curl</cmdname> commands to
   walk down the list of key names in order to get their values.</p>
