 <title>Linux and Windows Instances</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>A Linux instance store-backed instance actually consists of three separate images:<ul
        id="ul_4rn_pjw_df">
        <li>The Linux boot disk image (EMI) as previously defined</li>
        <li>A Eucalyptus kernel image (EKI), which is a low level operating system component that
          interfaces with the instance's virtual hardware</li>
        <li>A Eucalyptus ramdisk image (ERI) - the initrd - which is the initial root file system
          that is loaded as part of the kernel boot procedure and loads modules that make it
          possible to access the real root file system in the second stage of the boot process</li>
      </ul></p>
  <p>When a Linux instance is launched, these three images (along with a few other files) are bound
      together using loop devices so that they appear as a single disk to the Linux operating system
      running in the instance.  For Linux images, the same kernel and ramdisk files can be shared
      across multiple boot disk images, which allows for more efficient use of storage.</p>

  <p>A Windows instance store-backed instance consists only of the bootable file system image (EMI).
      The reason for this is that in the Windows operating system the kernel and ramdisk components
      cannot be separated from the boot disk image, and thus each copy of a Windows image must also
      contain a copy of these components. </p>
