 <conbody>
  <p>Once logged in, you will have access to the Administrator Console. <image
                href="images/The-Dashboard-Initial-Screen.png" placement="break"
                id="image_45x_3nr_ff" scale="50"/></p>
  <p/>
  <p>The header area includes the logo, the link to a user profile setting menu, and the big search
   box. </p>
  <p>The Quick Links area provides links to various contents of the Administrator Console. It is
            organized into sections made up of two levels. The top level is a heading for that
            section. Under each heading is a second section that contains a list of links.</p>
  <p>The center part of the main screen displays the main panel, usually the search results list. In
            many content displays, the Administrator Console displays a toolbar that contains action
            buttons. The bottom of the content area provides the page navigation controls.</p>
  <p>The bar at the bottom of the main screen shows system status messages, log window toggle button
   and the software version (from left to right). </p>
