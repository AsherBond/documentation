 <title>Proof-of-Concept Installation</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>This section illustrates a proof-of-concept installation on CentOS 6.3 running the KVM
      hypervisor. You will install from packages.<note>For installation guides on other Linux
        distributions and versions, refer to the <i>Installation Guide</i> at <xref
          href="https://www.eucalyptus.comdocs" format="html" scope="external"
          >http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs</xref>.</note></p>
  <p>A basic proof-of-concept installation requires two physical hosts, one for the front-end
      components (Cloud Controller, Walrus, Cluster Controller, and Storage Controller) and another
      as a Node Controller.</p>
