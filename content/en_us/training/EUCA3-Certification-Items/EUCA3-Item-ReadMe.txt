ITEM BANK IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ON GITHUB.

Note: In some cases an item has been modified to reflect current product realities. What are believed to be the correct answers are still correct, however the notes on those items may contain information regarding multi-hypervisor deployments that is inaccurate and not a factor in the redesigned test question any more. Assistance in cleaning up these items is greatly appreciated. :)
