	<glossdef>The Cluster Controller (CC) generally executes on a machine
		that has network connectivity to both the machines running the Node
		Controller (NC) and to the machine running the CLC. CCs gather
		information about a set of node machines and schedules virtual
		machine (VM) execution on specific nodes. The CC also manages the
		virtual machine networks and participates in the enforcement of
		SLAs[SM3] as directed by the CLC. All NCs associated with a single
		CC must be in the same broadcast domain (Ethernet).</glossdef>
