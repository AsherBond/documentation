			<p>You can upgrade to Eucalyptus <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/>
				from <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/prev_version"/>. To upgrade from any other
				version of Eucalyptus, you should first upgrade to either <ph
					conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/prev_version"/>. Follow the
				directions in the previous Installation Guide, and then upgrade to <ph conref="../shared/conrefs.dita#prod/version"/>
				using these directions.</p>
			
			<note type="important">Eucalyptus does not support components that are at different releases,
				even at the sub-minor level. For
				example, you cannot have a CLC at 3.3.1 and a Walrus at 3.3.0. Please
				make sure that you update all Eucalyptus components when you
			        upgrade.</note>
