	<title>Verify TCP/IP Connectivity</title>
	<shortdesc/>
	<taskbody>
		<context>
			<p> Verify connectivity between the machines youâ€™ll be installing
				Eucalyptus on. Some Linux distributions provide default TCP/IP
				firewalling rules that limit network access to machines. Disable
				these default firewall settings before you install Eucalyptus
				components to ensure that the components can communicate with
				one another.</p>
			<p>Verify component connectivity by performing the following checks
				on the machines that will be running the listed Eucalyptus
				components. </p>
