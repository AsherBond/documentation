			<title>Restricting network access</title>
			<p>This section provides basic guidance on setting up a firewall
				around your Eucalyptus components. It is not intended to be
				exhaustive.</p>
			<p>On the CLC, you should allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inbound from end-users on TCP ports 8773 and 8443</li>
				<li>Inbound from CC and Eucalyptus instances (public IPs) on
					port 8773 (for metadata service)</li>
				<li>Inbound from Walrus, SC, and VB on TCP port 8777</li>
				<li>Inbound from Walrus, SC, and VB over TCP</li>
				<li>Inbound from Walrus, SC, and VB on UDP port 7500</li>
				<li>Multicast from CLC, SC, and VB to IP 228.7.7.3 on UDP port
					8773</li>
				<li>Inbound and outbound to DNS ports</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the CC, you should ensure that all firewall rules are
				compatible with the dynamic changes performed by Eucalyptus,
				described in the section below. You should also allow the
				following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inbound from CLC on TCP port 8774</li>
				<li>Inbound from NC on port TCP 8776, if CC image proxying is
					enabled</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On Walrus, you should allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inbound from end-users on TCP port 8773</li>
				<li>Inbound from SC, NC, and VB on TCP port 8773</li>
				<li>Inbound from CC on port TCP 8773, if CC image proxying is
					enabled</li>
				<li>Inbound from CLC, SC, and VB over TCP</li>
				<li>Inbound from CLC, SC, and VB on UDP port 7500</li>
				<li>Multicast from CLC, SC, and VB to IP 228.7.7.3 on UDP port
					8773</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the SC, you should allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inbound from CLC, NC, and VB on TCP port 8773</li>
				<li>Inbound from CLC, Walrus, and VB over TCP</li>
				<li>Inbound from CLC, Walrus, and VB on UDP port 7500</li>
				<li>Multicast from CLC, Walrus, and VB to IP 228.7.7.3 on UDP
					port 8773</li>
				<li>Inbound from NC on TCP port 3260, if tgt (iSCSI open source
					target) is used for EBS storage</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the NC, you should allow the following connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inbound from CC on TCP port 8775</li>
				<li>Inbound from other NCs on port 16514</li>
				<li>DHCP traffic forwarding to VMs</li>
				<li>Traffic forwarding to and from instances' private IP
					addresses</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On the VMware Broker, you should allow the following
				connections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inbound from CC on TCP port 8773</li>
				<li>Inbound from CLC, Walrus, and SC over TCP</li>
				<li>Inbound from CLC, Walrus, and SC on UDP port 7500</li>
				<li>Multicast from CLC, Walrus, and SC to IP 228.7.7.3 on UDP
					port 8773</li>
			</ul>

			<title>Managing iptables rules for the CC</title>
			<p>In Managed and Managed (No VLAN) modes, Eucalyptus flushes the
				CC's iptables rules for both <codeph>filter</codeph> and
					<codeph>nat</codeph>, then it sets the default policy for
				the <codeph>FORWARD</codeph> chain in <codeph>filter</codeph> to
					<codeph>DROP</codeph>. At run time, the CC adds and removes
				rules from <codeph>FORWARD</codeph> as users add and remove
				ingress rules from their active security groups. In addition,
				the <codeph>nat</codeph> table is configured to allow VMs access
				to the external network using IP masquerading, and dynamically
				adds/removes rules in the <codeph>nat</codeph> table as users
				assign and unassign public IPs to VMs at instance boot or
				run-time. </p>
			<p>If you have rules you want to apply on the CC, make the following
				edit on the CC before you start Eucalyptus or while Eucalyptus
				is stopped:</p>
			<codeblock>iptables-save > /etc/eucalyptus/iptables-preload</codeblock>
			<note type="caution">Performing this operation to define special
				iptables rules that are loaded when Eucalyptus starts could
				cause Eucalyptus VM networking to fail. We recommend that you
				only do this if you are completely sure that it will not
				interfere with the operation of Eucalyptus.</note>
