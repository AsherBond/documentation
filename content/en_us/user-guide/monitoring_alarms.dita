 		<title>Common Features of Alarms</title>
 	<ul>
 	<li>You can create up to 5000 alarms per Eucalyptus account. To create or update an alarm, use the
 		<apiname>euwatch-put-metric-alarm</apiname> command.</li>
 	
 		<li>You can list any or all of the currently configured alarms, and list any alarms in a
 			particular state using the <apiname>euwatch-describe-alarms</apiname> command. You can further filter the list by time range.</li>
 	
 		<li>You can disable and enable alarms by using the <apiname>euwatch-disable-alarm-actions</apiname> and <apiname>euwatch-enable-alarm-actions</apiname> commands</li>
 	
 		<li>You can test an alarm by setting it to any state using the <apiname>euwatch-set-alarm-state</apiname> command. This temporary state change lasts only until the next alarm comparison occurs.</li>
 	
 		<li>Finally, you can view an alarm's history using the <apiname>euwatch-describe-alarm-history</apiname> command. CloudWatch preserves alarm history for two weeks. Each state transition is marked with a unique time stamp. In rare cases, your history might show more than one notification for a state change. The time stamp enables you to confirm unique state changes.</li>
