	<title>Getting Started</title>
	<shortdesc>This section helps you get started using your Eucalyptus cloud, including an overview
		of the features available to end users, how to sign up for an account, get credentials, and
		set the environment variables that enable you to interact with Eucalyptus.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p> As a cloud user, you can access the Eucalyptus cloud using a command line interface such
			as Euca2ools, or using a web-based interface such as the Eucalyptus User Console. You
			can switch between them freely. What you create in one will be accessible through the
			other. </p>
		<p>To access Eualyptus, you need keys for Euca2ools and a password for the User Console. To
			request access, talk to your cloud administrator. <!--If you are using Euca2ools and want to
			get started, see <xref href="../euca2ools-guide/index.dita"/>. If you are using the
			Eucalyptus User Console and want to get started, see <xref
				href="../console-guide/index.dita"/>.--></p>
