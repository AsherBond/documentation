						<entry>VMware Broker requires <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph> user to have write
							access to the <filepath>/etc/eucalyptus</filepath> directory (<xref
								format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/BROKER-9"
								>BROKER-9</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>If the <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph> user does not have write access to
							the <filepath>/etc/eucalyptus</filepath> directory, the VMware Broker
							will stay in a <codeph>BROKEN</codeph> state, and
								<codeph>euca-configure-vmware</codeph> will fail. Run <codeph>chown
								-R eucalyptus:eucalyptus /etc/eucalyptus/</codeph> on the VMware
							Broker machine to ensure that the <codeph>eucalyptus</codeph> user owns
							the necessary files.</entry>

					<row>
						<entry>The User Console exhibits odd behavior (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4530"
								>EUCA-4530</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>TThe User Console is intended to work with normal user accounts. If you log in with the
							<userinput>eucalyptus</userinput> account, the User
							Console will not work correctly on some pages, such as Elastic IPs.</entry>

						<entry>Some components are initialized rather than disabled after an
							unexpected reboot (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4354"
								>EUCA-4354</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>This only occurs when CLC, Walrus, and SC are located on the same
							machine in an HA setting. In an unexpected reboot within that setting,
							when the redundant components switch roles, some secondary components
							can become initialized rather than disabled. For a workaround, restart
							the initialized components. We strongly recommend that you use one
							machine for each Eucalyptus component in HA mode.</entry>

						<entry>User console requires upload of private key to access a Windows
							instance password (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4293"
								>EUCA-4293</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>Passwords for Windows instances are encrypted for a specified key
							pair. The user console requires that you upload the appropriate private
							key to access an instance password. <b>We strongly recommend against
								using this feature without HTTPS!</b> To access the instance
							password without uploading your private key, use
								<codeph>euca-get-password [instance id] -k [keyfile]</codeph> on the

						<entry>The user console continues to display an old password after a Windows
							instance is stopped and restarted. You must log out of the user console,
							log in again, and then generate a password, in order to log in to a
							Windows instance that has been stopped and restarted.</entry>

								>EUCA-4271</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>If a new instance is constructed in a group concurrently with network
							resources being freed in that group, a <codeph>RollbackException: Error
								while committing the transaction</codeph> error is thrown. This also
							results in an orphaned volume that cannot be deleted until the VM
							metadata has timed out and the volume is recognised as unused. Running
							the new instance a second time should succeed. </entry>

						<entry>Running <codeph>deregister-image</codeph> does not initially delete
							the image record for a snapshot that was registered as an image. You
							must run <codeph>deregister-image</codeph> twice to ensure the image is
							deleted.</entry>

						<entry>If <codeph>CC_IMAGE_PROXY_PATH</codeph> in

								>EUCA-4177</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>The DBResourceCheck class frequently polls to determine the number of
							active database connections for a given alias. This can result in a
							DBResourceCheck exception. This exception is expected, and is not
							fatal.</entry>

						<entry>The reporting feature in the Eucalyptus Administrator Console show no
							metrics. (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4168"

						<entry>This occurs only if you run a report that includes the current date.
							The metrics that show no data are: <uicontrol>CpuUsage%</uicontrol>,
								<uicontrol>Net Total In/Out</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Disk
								R/W</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Disk IOPS R/W</uicontrol>, and
								<uicontrol>DiskTime</uicontrol>. For a workaround, use the CLI
							command, <apiname>eureport-generate-report</apiname>, to run reports
							from the Cloud Controller for a time period that includes the current
							date. You can also use the Eucalyptus Administrator Console and move the
							end date up the previous day.</entry>

						<entry>The <codeph>euca-describe-bundle-tasks</codeph> command does not keep
							task status after task completes (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4140"
								>EUCA-4140</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>When bundling a Windows instance, the task is removed from the task
							list as soon as the bundle completes, so euca-describe-bundle-tasks
							never shows a 'complete' status.</entry>

						<entry>If the cluster controller image cache is set to zero, attempts to
							create an instance from an uncached image will remain pending
							indefinitely. To prevent images being cached, remove the
								<codeph>CC_IMAGE_PROXY</codeph> line from
								<filepath>eucalyptus.conf</filepath>.</entry>

						<entry>[error:0290] message printed on upgrade (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4027"
								>EUCA-4027</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>The Eucalyptus upgrade process requires a large number of file
							descriptors, and an error may occur if <codeph>ulimit</codeph> is not
							set to an appropriate value. To avoid this error, set <codeph>ulimit -n
								5000</codeph> before upgrading Eucalyptus. This error is not an
							indication of a failed upgrade.</entry>

						<entry>Unable to start stopped instances after upgrade (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4026"

						<entry>Eucalyptus 3.2 manages ISCSI targets in a different way to previous
							versions. The first attempt to start any stopped instances relying on
								<codeph>iscsiadm</codeph> will fail, but the issue is resolved
							during cleanup so subsequent requests for that instance will
							work.</entry>

						<entry>Must use user-friendly names for mulitpathing(<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-504"
								>DOC-504</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>Eucalyptus connect scripts assume multipathing uses user friendly
							names instead of WWID for the multipath device names, so the

						<entry>RollbackException error while committing transaction failure when
							attempting to run a BFEBS instance(<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4271"
								>EUCA-4271</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>In some cases, network resources (primarily vlan tags for the network
							group) are freed concurrently while a new instance is being constructed
							in that same group. If the network group is seen to have no more
							instances, then the CC can timeout the vlan tag and then inform the CLC,
							which frees the vlan tag resource. If there is a concurrent instance
							being constructed, however, an attempt may be made to use that vlan tag,
							and upon volume attach the database update fails because the
							vlan/network tag record doesn't exist. When this happens, the instance
							will stay in a 'pending' state with an IP address of 0.0.0.0 for a very
							long time. There is no long-term negative effect of this condition. To
							resolve this issue, you should proceed with terminating the instance,
							deleting its resulting volume if necessary, and then re-running the
							instance. </entry>

					<row>
						<entry>ERR-1009 "Mismatched cryptographical keys" gets written too many
							times in cc-fault.log (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-3986"
								>EUCA-3986</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>Currently, CC may log this fault once for each process in the pool.
							This is because the logic that suppresses duplicate faults relies on
							process-local memory rather than memory regions shared across CC
							processes.</entry>

						<entry>Eucalyptus Console https redirect doesn't work (<xref format="html"
								href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-4104"
								>EUCA-4104</xref>)</entry>
						<entry>When SSL is enabled for the user console, http requests do not
							automatically redirect to the proper https address, which can result in
							a blank page.</entry>
