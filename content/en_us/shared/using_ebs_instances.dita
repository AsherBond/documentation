 <title>Using EBS-Backed Instances</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>An EBS-backed instance is very much like a physical machine in the way it boots and persists
   data.  Because an EBS-backed instance functions in a manner similar to physical machine, it makes
   it a good choice to run legacy applications that cannot be re-architected for the cloud.  </p>

  <p/>
  <p>EBS-backed instances provide a workaround for the 10GB size limit for instance store-backed EMI
   images.  This is particularly important for Windows instances which can easily exceed 10GB in
   size. EBS-backed instances have a maximum size of 1TB.</p>
  <p>An EBS-backed boot volume can still be protected by taking a snapshot of it.  In fact, other
   non-boot volumes can be attached to the EBS-backed instance and they can be protected using
   snapshots too.</p>
