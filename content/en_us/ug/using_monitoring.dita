 <title>Using CloudWatch</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
 	<p>CloudWatch is a Eucalyptus service that enables you to monitor, manage, and publish various
 		metrics, as well as configure alarm actions based on data from metrics. You can use the default
 		metrics that come with Eucalyptus, or you can use your own metrics.</p>
 	<p>CloudWatch collects raw data from your cloud's resources and generates the information into
 		readable, near real-time metrics. These metrics are recorded for a period of two weeks. This
 		allows you to access historical information and provides you with information about how your
 		resource is performing. </p>
