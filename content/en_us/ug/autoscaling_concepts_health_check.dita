 <title>Understanding the Health Check</title>

 <conbody>
  <p> Auto scaling periodically checks to see if the instances in your auto scaling group are responsive. If any instance in the auto 
scaling group does not respond to the health check with an OK, it is marked as 'unhealthy' and automatically replaced in the auto scaling 
group with a new instance. </p>
