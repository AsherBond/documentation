 <title>Object Storage</title>
	<shortdesc>Eucalyptus supports Walrus and Riak as its object storage backend. There is no extra
		planning if you use Walrus. If you use Riak, you can use a single Riak cluster for several
		Eucalptus clouds. Basho recommends five nodes for each Riak cluster. This also means that you have to set up and configure a load
		balancer between the Riak nodes and the object storage gateway (OSG).</shortdesc>
