	<title>Object Storage</title>
	<shortdesc>Eucalyptus supports Walrus and Riak as its object storage backend. There is no extra
		planning if you use Walrus. If you use Riak, Basho recommends that you run no fewer than five data
		servers for each Eucalyptus cluster. This also means that you have to set up and configure a load
		balancer between the Riak servers and the object storage gateway (OSG).</shortdesc>
