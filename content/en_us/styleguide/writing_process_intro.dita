 <title>Introduction Writing Process</title>
 <shortdesc>This section provides a list of guidelines for writing an introduction narrative.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <ol>
   <li>State the formal name of the product or the feature you are describing clearly. Get the names
    right and use variables to assure consistent use.</li>
   <li>Describe succinctly what does it does or how it works: <ul>
     <li>Be crisp and to the point. The key is to keep it short and simple. You just want the reader
      to get the big picture at this point.</li>
     <li>Depending on how complex it is, you might need a high-level flow diagram, a process
      description, or a couple simple and short declarative statements. </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Give an example showing how someone could apply the product/feature. If you do it right, you
    can start a base example here and build on it throughout the doc.</li>
   <li>Tell the readers where to get more info (e.g., greater details, how-tos, and
   references).</li>
   <li>Stop. Don't overdo it.</li>
  </ol>
