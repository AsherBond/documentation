	<title>References to Structured Information</title>
	<shortdesc>If the information is directly integral to your subject matter, such as a glossary term,
		action, or data type, you can simply use linked text for your reference.</shortdesc>

			<dlentry>
				<dt>Glossary Terms</dt>

				<dd> Directly link to the other page without explanation if the link connects to a
					definition, or is a part of a list or table of references. <p>Link to terms defined in the
						glossary the first time the term appears on each HTML page. For instructions on working
						with glossaries, go to ZonBook Tips.</p>
				</dd>

			<dlentry>
				<dt>API Actions and Data Types</dt>

				<dd>Link to an action/function in the API reference only the first time the term appears on
					each HTML page. (Caveat: extremely long pages can have more than one link.) Like a
					glossary reference, no explanatory text is required.</dd>

				<dt>SDK and Command Line Tool Links</dt>

				<dd>Link to a command or method only the first time the term appears on each HTML page. Like
