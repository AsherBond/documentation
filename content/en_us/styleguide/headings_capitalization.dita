 <title>Capitalization of titles and headings</title>

 <conbody>
  <p>As noted in this heading, Eucalyptus will be migrating to the less formal sentence-style
  	captitalization for headings. Document titles will retain title case in all guides.</p>
 	<p>For example, the <b>Developer Guide</b> (title) might have a chapter, <b>Submit your code</b>.</p>
