  <p>The Dashboard is the initial screen you are presented with when you log in to the User
   Console.Â  The Dashboard quickly provides information about the status of instances, storage, and
   network and security resources. You can also use the Dashboard to navigate to other screens where
   you can perform actions in the cloud. Performing actions in the cloud using the User Console is
   discussed in other sections of the course when they are relevant the topic.</p>
