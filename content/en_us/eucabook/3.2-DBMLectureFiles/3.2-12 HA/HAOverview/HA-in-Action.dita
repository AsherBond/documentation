 <conbody>
  <p>Eucalyptus HA can maintain cloud operation during multiple failures as long as both services in
   a service pair do not simultaneously fail and the service is available through a network
   interface. In the example below, six services have failed and yet the cloud would continue proper
   operation.</p>
