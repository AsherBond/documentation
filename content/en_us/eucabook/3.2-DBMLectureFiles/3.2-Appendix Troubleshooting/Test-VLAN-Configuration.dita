 <title>Test VLAN Operation</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>If you are running in MANAGED network mode, you need to ensure that the network infrastructure
      connecting the Node Controllers and the Cluster Controller can properly handle VLAN tagged
      packets.Â  Use the following commands to perform a test:<ol id="ol_j4v_5vv_bh">
        <li>On the Cluster Controller configure a virtual network interface that is on a VLAN. In
          this example, it is VLAN 10:
          <codeblock>vconfig add eth1 10
ifconfig eth1.10 192.168.1.1 up</codeblock></li>
        <li>On the Node Controller configure another virtual network interface that is on the same
          VLAN. In this example, it is VLAN 10:
          <codeblock>vconfig add eth0 10
ifconfig eth0.10 192.168.1.2 up</codeblock></li>
        <li>From each host, <cmdname>ping</cmdname> the IP address of the other host in order to
          verify connectivity over the VLAN.</li>
        <li>To remove the virtual network interface configuration following the test:
          <codeblock>vconfig rem eth1.10
vconfig rem eth0.10</codeblock></li>
      </ol></p>
