 <title>VLAN-Clean Testing</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>In MANAGED mode the Cloud Controller will automatically ensure that each security group
   (subnet) is assigned a unique VLAN ID.   This means that Ethernet packets flowing between the
   Cluster Controller and the Node Controllers will be VLAN tagged.  This creates two requirements
   for the network switches between the Cluster Controller and Node Controllers.  First, they must
   be able to read and forward VLAN-tagged packets.  Second, these network switches must not already
   be using any VLAN IDs that Eucalyptus will be use for security groups.   Network switches that
   can read and forward VLAN-tagged packets and do not have any VLAN ID conflicts are said to be
    <i>VLAN clean</i> from a Eucalyptus perspective.</p>

  <p>To test whether the network segment between the Cluster Controller and Node Controller is VLAN
   clean will require two private IP addresses, a single VLAN ID, and some configuration work on the
   Cluster Controller and Node Controller network interfaces.</p>
  <p>On the Cluster Controller, configure the network interface that is reachable by the Node
   Controller with virtual network interface.  Configure the virtual network interface with a VLAN
   ID and an IP address. For example:<ul id="ul_n1f_m1l_1h">
    <li><cmdname>vconfig add eth1 10</cmdname></li>
    <li><cmdname>ifconfig eth1.10 192.168.1.1 up</cmdname></li>
   </ul></p>
  <p>On the Node Controller, configure the network interface that is reachable by the Cluster
   Controller with a virtual network interface.  The virtual network interface should be configured
   on the same VLAN ID but have a different IP address. For example:<ul id="ul_wjq_r1l_1h">
    <li><cmdname>vconfig add eth1 10</cmdname></li>
    <li><cmdname>ifconfig eth0.10 192.168.1.2 up</cmdname></li>
   </ul></p>
  <p>Once the network interfaces are configured, on VLAN 10 in this example, trying using the
    <cmdname>ping</cmdname> command from one host to the other  host. If it is successful then the
   network segment is VLAN clean. While this only tests a single VLAN ID, it does indicate that the
   network infrastructure does support VLAN tagging.</p>
  <p>Following the example above, you would remove the virtual interfaces using the syntax
    <cmdname>vconfig rem eth1.10</cmdname> and <cmdname>vconfig rem eth0.10</cmdname>.</p>
