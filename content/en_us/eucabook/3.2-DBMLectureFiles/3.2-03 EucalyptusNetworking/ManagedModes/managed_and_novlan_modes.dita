 <title>MANAGED and MANAGED-NOVLAN Modes</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>The two MANAGED networking modes are the most common modes used in Eucalyptus cloud
      deployments. In either mode, the Eucalyptus cloud assumes responsibility for assigning IP
      addresses to instances in a controlled subnet, regardless of the presence of a DHCP server on
      the corporate network. In addition, the user can configure and use both elastic IP addresses
      and security groups. The only difference between MANAGED and MANAGED-NOVLAN is that MANAGED
      mode utilizes VLAN tagging for virtual machine instance isolation between security groups,
      whereas MANAGED-NOVLAN does not.</p>

    <p>Like STATIC and SYSTEM modes, in MANAGED-NOVLAN mode a bridge must be configured on the Node
      Controllers for Eucalyptus to use. In MANAGED mode, a bridge is automatically created by the
      Eucalyptus software and therefore should not be created ahead of time. In MANAGED mode, for
      each security group there is a bridge automatically created on both the Cluster Controller and
      Node Controller.Â  These bridges are VLAN tagged interfaces. </p>

    <p/>
    <p>The physical layout of the MANAGED (-NOVLAN) modes requires isolation of the DHCP server on
      the Cluster Controller to prevent it from giving out IP addresses to non-Eucalyptus machines.
      The IT administration team must take external precautions to ensure that this does not
      happen.</p>
