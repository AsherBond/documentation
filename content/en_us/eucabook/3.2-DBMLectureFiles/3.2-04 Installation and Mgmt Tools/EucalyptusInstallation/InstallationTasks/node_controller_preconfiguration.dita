 <title>Node Controller Pre-Configuration</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>SYSTEM, STATIC, and MANAGED-NOVLAN network modes require a KVM bridge to be configured prior to
   software installation. MANAGED mode, however, will automatically create and manage the necessary
   network bridges for you.</p>
  <p>KVM virtual bridges must be configured manually. The actual configuration steps vary by Linux
   distribution and version. For more information about configuring a network bridge for your Linux
   distribution, see the Installation Guide at http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs. </p>
