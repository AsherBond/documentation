 <title>Metadata and EMI Management</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Metadata services allow a user to build generic EMIs that are customized by metadata services
   information at launch time. This simplifies EMI management. The ability to run many instance
   configurations from a small number of EMIs means that there are less EMIs to create and manage
   over time.</p>
