 <title>Downloading Credentials</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>By default, a new cloud user does not have credentials. Users can create and download their own
      credentials once they log into the Eucalyptus Administrator Console. However, even a user with
      credentials they will still need to be given permission to use cloud resources. These
      permissions are granted by a cloud or account administrator when they create access control
      policies.</p>
