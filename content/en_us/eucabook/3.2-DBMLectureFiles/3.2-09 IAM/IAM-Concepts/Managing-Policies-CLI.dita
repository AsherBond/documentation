 <title>Manage Policies - Command Line</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Starting with Eucalyptus 3, a new set of command-line commands were added. These commands all
   use the prefix <cmdname>euare-*</cmdname> (pronounced "you are"). The <cmdname>euare-*</cmdname>
   commands are used to manage EIAM functionality, including policies, accounts, users, and
   groups.</p>
