 <title>Deleting Accounts</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Accounts can be deleted from the Eucalyptus Administrator Console or the command line.</p>
    <p>To delete an account from the Administrator Console select <uicontrol>Accounts</uicontrol> in
      the QUICK LINKS panel, select the account you wish to delete, and click the <uicontrol>Delete
        accounts</uicontrol> button.  Once you confirm the operation, the account and all users,
      keys, certificates, passwords, and groups in the account will be deleted.  </p>

  <p>The <cmdname>euare-accountdel</cmdname> command deletes accounts. It has the following
   syntax:<codeblock>euare-accountdel –r –a &lt;account_name></codeblock></p>
  <p>The <cmdname>–r</cmdname> option recursively deletes the account.   This means that all users
      and groups in the account are deleted along with the account.  This includes any user keys,
      certificates, and login profiles. </p>
