 <title>Delete an Image</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Once deregistered, a single image can be deleted from the Walrus.  An entire bucket can also be
      deleted from the Walrus.</p>
  <p>To delete a specific image, first run <cmdname>euca-describe-images</cmdname> to view the
      bucket name and manifest file name. To delete the image, run the following
      command:<codeblock>euca-delete-bundle -b &lt;bucket> -p &lt;manifest_file_prefix></codeblock></p>
    <p/>
    <p>
      <image href="images/Deleting-an-Image.png" placement="break" id="image_2yw_qbm_h3" scale="60"
      />
    </p>
    <p/>
  <p>The manifest file prefix is everything in the manifest file name up to but not including the
    <filepath>.manifest.xml</filepath> suffix.</p>
  <p>To delete an entire bucket, run the command without specifying a manifest prefix. Use the
        <cmdname>--clear</cmdname> option
      instead:<codeblock>euca-delete-bundle -b &lt;bucket> --clear</codeblock></p>
    <p/>
    <p>

      />

      <note><b>Caution</b>: Remember to deregister images before deleting them!</note>
