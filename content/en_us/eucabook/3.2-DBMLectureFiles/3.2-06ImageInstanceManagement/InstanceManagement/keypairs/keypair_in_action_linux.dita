 <title>Key Pair in Action - Linux</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>To access an instance that was launched using a key pair, use the following command: a</p>
  <p>
   <codeblock># ssh -i &lt;key_file> &lt;ip_address></codeblock>
  </p>
  <p>The diagram below illustrates how public/private key authentication works during log in to an
   instance.  First, the <cmdname>euca-add-keypair</cmdname> command creates a public/private key
   pair.  This key pair is known by a name assigned by the user.  The private key is placed in a
   file and stored where ever the user decides to store their key files, their home directory for
   example.  The public key file is stored in the Cloud Controller database.  </p>
  <p>When the user later launches an instance, they specify the name of the key pair that will be
   used to authenticate log in attempts to the instance.  The instance's start up scripts are
   configured to download the user's public key from the Cloud Controller database during boot up.
   When the user then uses Secure Shell to log in to the instance, they specify the name of the file
   containing the matching private key.  If the private key matches the public key, the user is
   granted access.</p>
