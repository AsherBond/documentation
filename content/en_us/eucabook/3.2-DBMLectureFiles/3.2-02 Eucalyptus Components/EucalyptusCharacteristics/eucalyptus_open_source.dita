            assess its security. Whatever your use case, you have the source code at your
            fingertips. </p>
  <p>The source code is available on GitHub at <xref href="https://github.com/eucalyptus"
    format="html" scope="external">https://github.com/eucalyptus</xref>. Bug reports are created and
   tracked using Jira.Â  Jira can be found at <xref href="https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net"
    format="html" scope="external">https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net</xref>. </p>
  <p>The Eucalyptus development process is in the open, as are bug reports, community contributions,
   and security advisories. This means that companies that deploy Eucalyptus can be assured that the
   product has been thoroughly vetted by the open source community, and any issues discovered can be
   mitigated in a rapid fashion.</p>
