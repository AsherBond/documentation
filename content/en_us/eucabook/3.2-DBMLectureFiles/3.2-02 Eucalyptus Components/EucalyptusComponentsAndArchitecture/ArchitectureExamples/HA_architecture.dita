 <title>High Availability Architectures</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Eucalyptus High Availability (HA) provides redundancy for the cloud and cluster-layer
      components in the architecture. It allows the configuration of passive services for these
      components on separate hardware to avoid single-points-of-failure for cloud services.
      Eucalyptus HA is discussed more extensively in another training module.</p>
