    <p>A variety of storage types can be used to provide the storage space for Walrus buckets. The
      storage space from this storage should be reachable by the Walrus beneath the directory
        <cmdname>/var/lib/eucalyptus/bukkits</cmdname>. Whichever storage type you choose, consider
      reliability, disaster recovery, bandwidth, and the ability to increase the capacity of the
      storage to accommodate future growth. </p>
    <p>If you have mounted your Walrus storage over NFS, then ensure that you use the NFS options
        <i>hard</i>,<i>nointr</i>,<i>sync</i>.   This ensures that data written to the Walrus is
      safely written to the back-end storage.Â  </p>
