 <title>Security Groups Example</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Here is an example of security group design that controls access to a multi-tiered
   application.  Each tier in the application is protected by its own security group.  Each security
   group controls connection requests from users outside of the cloud as well as connection requests
   from the other security groups within the cloud.  </p>

  <p/>
  <p>The <i>web</i> security group allows users outside of the cloud to access the Web servers using
   TCP ports 80 and 443  This provides these users access to the Web-based application.  Web
   administrators are allowed access to the Web servers through Secure Shell at TCP port 22.  All
   other ports are blocked.  </p>
  <p>The <i>app</i> security group allows Secure Shell access from application administrators
   through TCP port 22.   It also permits access from the Web server instances in the <i>web</i>
   security group.  All other ports are blocked.</p>
  <p>Finally, the <i>db</i> security group allows Secure Shell access from database administrators
   through TCP port 22.   It also permits access from the application server instances in the
    <i>app</i> security group.  All other ports are blocked.</p>
