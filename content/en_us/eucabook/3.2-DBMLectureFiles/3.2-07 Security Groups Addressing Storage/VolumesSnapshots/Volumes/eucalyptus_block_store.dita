 <title>Eucalyptus Block Store</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Eucalyptus enables you to create persistent storage volumes called Eucalyptus block volumes.
   This is the Eucalyptus version of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS). Volumes are mounted as SCSI
   devices by instances. For example, in a cloud running the KVM hypervisor a volume in a Linux
   instance appears as an <i>vd</i> device in the <filepath>/dev</filepath> directory. <note>The use
    of a <i>vd</i> device assumes that VIRTIO disk paravirtualization enabled, otherwise <i>sd</i>
    devices appear in the <filepath>/dev</filepath> directory.</note>Once a volume is attached to an
   instance, it behaves like a raw, unformatted block device. You can create a file system on a
   volume or use a volume in any other way you would use a block device. </p>
  <p>A volume is a per-cluster resource. A volume is available only within an individual cluster and
   is not available across clusters.</p>
