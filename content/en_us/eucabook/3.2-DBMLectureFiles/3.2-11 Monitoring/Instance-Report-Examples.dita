  <p>In these example reports, the user admin in the eucalyptus account has had two instances
      running for at least one day. Together, those instances have generated less than 1GB of either
      network or disk I/O.  The users bob and claus in the sales account have had one instance each
      running for less than a day.  Neither of the instances have generated 1GB of network or disk
      I/O up to this point in time. </p>
