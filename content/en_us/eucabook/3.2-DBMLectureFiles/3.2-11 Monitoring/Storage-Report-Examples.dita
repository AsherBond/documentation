 <title>Storage Report Examples</title>

 <conbody>
  <p>This first example shows a storage report where <b>Criteria</b> was set to <b>Account</b>, and
    <b>Group by</b> was set to <b>None</b>. </p>

  <p>The next example shows an instance report where <b>Criteria</b> was again set to
   <b>Account</b>, but this time <b>Group by</b> was set to <b>Availability Zone</b>.</p>

    <p>The report contains values for Max (GB) and GB-days. Max (GB) reports the maximum number of
      GBs that were deployed during the report period. GB-days refers to [number of days allocated]
      x [number of GBs allocated]. Bear in mind that number of days and GBs can be fractional, and
      it adds them all up. You could have 80 volumes of 100MB, each allocated for 3 hours, and the
      result would be 1 GB-Day (0.1*80*/(24/3)).</p>
  <p>In these example reports, the users in the eucalyptus account consumed less than 1GB of storage
   controller space for less than 1 day for both volumes and snapshots.  The same is true for the
   users in the sales account.</p>
