		<p>This guide is intended for people who are currently using Eucalyptus
			and who want to harden the cloud and underlying configuration.</p>

		<p>This guide covers available controls and best practices for securing
			your Eucalyptus cloud. Cloud security depends on the security of
			several layers of infrastructure and technology:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Security of the physical infrastructure</li>
			<li>Security of the virtual infrastructure</li>
			<li>Security of the host operating systems (OS)</li>
			<li>Security of instances</li>
			<li>Security of the network and firewall</li>
			<li>Security of attached volumes and data</li>
			<li>Security of users and accounts</li>
		</ul>
