		<p>This guide is intended for people who are currently using Eucalyptus
			and who want to harden the cloud and underlying configuration.</p>

		<p>This guide covers available controls and best practices for securing
			your Eucalyptus cloud. Cloud security depends on security across
			many layers of infrastructure and technology:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Security of the physical infrastructure and hosts</li>
			<li>Security of the virtual infrastructure</li>
			<li>Security of instances</li>
			<li>Security of storage and data</li>
			<li>Security of users and accounts</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For background information on cloud security, we recommend the Amazon
