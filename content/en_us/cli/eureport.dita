 <title>Eucalyptus Report Commands</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
 	<p>Eucalyptus allows you to get reports from either the Cloud Controller (CLC) or the data
 		warehouse. Reports from the data warehouse are from data exported from the CLC. These reports
 		show data useful for understanding how your resources are being allocated, who is using the resources, and how much time resources are running.</p>
 	
 	<p>Commands that begin the <codeph>eureport-</codeph> are for the CLC. Commands that begin with
 		<codeph>eucadw-</codeph> are for the data warehouse.</p>
