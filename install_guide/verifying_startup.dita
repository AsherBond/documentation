 <conbody>
 	<p>At this point, all Eucalyptus components are enabled and starting up. Some of these services perform intensive initialization at start-up, particularly the first time they are started. You might have to wait a few minutes until they are fully operational.</p> 
 	<p>One quick way to determine if the components are running is to run netstat on the various hosts and look to see when the service ports are allocated to a process. Specifically, the CLC, Walrus, the SC, and the VMware Broker allocate ports 8773.  The CC listens to port 8774, and the NC uses port 8775.</p>
 	<p>Verify that everything has started without error.  Expected outcomes include:</p>
 <ul>	<li>Listening on ports 8773 for CLC/Walrus/SC/VMware Broker</li>
 	<li>Listening on port 8774 for CC</li>
 	<li>Listening on port 8775 for NC</li>
 	<li>The presence of appropriate logfiles in <filepath>/var/log/eucalyptus/</filepath></li></ul>
